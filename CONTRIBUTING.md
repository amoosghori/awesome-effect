## How to contribute

If you want to add a new item to the list, please create a new Pull Request.

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure the list is useful before submitting. That means the linked resource should be reasonably complete, well-documented and not deprecated.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[RESOURCE](LINK) - DESCRIPTION.`
- Make sure there is a newline at the end of the file.
- Link to the GitHub repository if available, not the website/documentation.
- The description should be short and simple, on a single line.
- Check your spelling and grammar.

Thank you for your suggestions!
